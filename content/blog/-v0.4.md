Implications:

* xyz, video on web
* Broader device support (no more Vulkan feature issues)
* macOS setup, iOS app bundle simpler (no more Vulkan)
* New C compiler on Windows; users who installed TDM-GCC previously or get warnings should run core setup again
* Need to reinstall the core tool for many of these changes; should probably mention toward the top and recommend doing for each new release
